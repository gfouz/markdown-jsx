## Brief introduction

I use modern JavaScript frameworks such as React and Vue to create
single page application or full static sites so that among my
skills are HTML, CSS, SCSS and JAVASCRIPT. And i am not afraid of
getting out of the comfort zone and trying out new things. I began
learning C plus plus in 2017 in order to write firmwares for
micro-controllers. I was studying this language for more than a
year but eventually i realized that i needed to learn technologies
that afford a job, so that i have been wagering on ReactJs as my
favourite choosing.
