[{"content":"## Brief introduction\r\n\r\nI use modern JavaScript frameworks such as React and Vue to create\r\nsingle page application or full static sites so that among my\r\nskills are HTML, CSS, SCSS and JAVASCRIPT. And i am not afraid of\r\ngetting out of the comfort zone and trying out new things. I began\r\nlearning C plus plus in 2017 in order to write firmwares for\r\nmicro-controllers. I was studying this language for more than a\r\nyear but eventually i realized that i needed to learn technologies\r\nthat afford a job, so that i have been wagering on ReactJs as my\r\nfavourite choosing."}]
